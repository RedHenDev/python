Could you give me a quick overview of what REPL means and basic ways to use this in the terminal for python?
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that allows you to execute code snippets and see the results immediately.

To use REPL in the terminal for Python, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can open a terminal and type python to enter the Python REPL.

Once you are in the Python REPL, you can start typing Python commands and press enter to execute them. For example, you can use the print() function to print a string:

Copy code
>>> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
You can also use the REPL to define variables and perform calculations:

Copy code
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> print(x + y)
15
To exit the Python REPL, you can use the exit() function or press CTRL + D.

[You can interrupt the process with Ctrl+C to get your prompt back.]

The Python REPL is a useful tool for testing out small pieces of code and exploring the language. It can also be used as a simple calculator.

Thanks. And how do you use code that spans several lines?
In the Python REPL, you can use the ... prompt to enter code that spans multiple lines. For example:

Copy code
>>> def greet(name):
...     print(f"Hello, {name}!")
... 
>>> greet("Alice")
Hello, Alice!
In this example, the def statement is used to define a function called greet, which takes a single argument name. The function uses the print() function to print a greeting. The function definition is spread across three lines, but it is treated as a single unit of code.

You can also use triple quotes (""" or ''') to define multi-line strings. For example:

Copy code
>>> message = """
... This is a multi-line
... string.
... """
>>> print(message)
This is a multi-line
string.
Finally, you can use the \ character to indicate that a statement continues on the next line. For example:

Copy code
>>> x = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
... 4 + 5
>>> print(x)
15
This can be useful when you want to write long statements that are more readable when spread across multiple lines.
