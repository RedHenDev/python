macOS
install PortAudio with Homebrew
then install PyAudio with pip:

$ brew install portaudio
$ pip install pyaudio
[NB I had to use following: python3 -m pip install pyaudio]

You can install SpeechRecognition from a terminal with pip:

$ pip install SpeechRecognition
Once installed, you should verify the installation by opening an interpreter session and typing:

>>>
>>> import speech_recognition as sr
>>> sr.__version__
'3.8.1'

If you’re wondering where the phrases in the “harvard.wav” file come from, they are examples of Harvard Sentences. These phrases were published by the IEEE in 1965 for use in speech intelligibility testing of telephone lines. They are still used in VoIP and cellular testing today.

The Harvard Sentences are comprised of 72 lists of ten phrases. You can find freely available recordings of these phrases on the Open Speech Repository website. Recordings are available in English, Mandarin Chinese, French, and Hindi. They provide an excellent source of free material for testing your code.
