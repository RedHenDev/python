'Conscience' [9/10/24]


There is a well-known secret place
where truth and feeling pair and sit
a room combining candlelit
the witness, tender taken worth
that some have called word divine
indeed nearly so
for find we time to down the devil
entertaining whiskey whispers
alchemical eyes greening more than animal
for finite love, inadequate thrones
but by candle and humble chair
weigh what had taken place
what our part
and in slow waxy heat
some transparent infant
visits us and breathes.


&&


'Morning Star'


This is the bit I don't like. The loss of -- light.
hold them cheats, those who never hung here.
Cold the unliving cliffs and undiscovered:
I come here willing, tread the little shale paths
under all shade with the colours all drained.
And why must I willingly?
I am one who is supposed to know so let me tell you:
it is not to learn the benefit of warmth
nor fruitfulness of honey and sand;
the lessons of this lightlessness are all practical.
Failure succeeds downwards, no success a fall.
Like shivering water helping a drowning one,
who you cannot save but risk yourself, drowning too.
What is the touch of sand recalling you did not try?
Who is the taste of honey for?
Wait for the dawn -- like a glass marble
rolled into your palm.
Like a charging lion too large and eyes screaming for rage-hunt.
Like falling, in a jolt, from a dream.
The dawn is like that.
That's to whom honey belongs.
By reason of a wedding breakfast, for instance.


It is said no animal sees reason.
They are all sense-of-smell and intelligence,
rational by rote but not creation:
their eyes never idle.
Here this way in the dark I'm surrounded by animals.
A bad number are predatory and seek me
and men here like animals call me 'useless'.
They trot or have sleek fur or dart
away, bushes and scrub, inaccessible places.
Nocturnal animals love secrets, jealous
of each other's powers and find fault with anything.
The people here are tired and similarly critical.
The powerless insecurely shore themselves up as judges
or wisdom givers, conspire inaccessible reasons
but are glad of warmth.
You have to be light on your feet
even beyond what you thought reasonable.
Skilful sailors are remarkable but not enough:
here you have to sculpt an unreasonable sea shape
for the hull, sailing flat-even with the absurd.


I know: it's ridiculous. But a species of evidence of something.
When you'd do anything you can do anything.
I can see in the dark.
I wish I couldn't. The mouths here.
I knew a girl could move a mustard-seed --
the architecture of that little thing
no less a wonder when she moved all molecules
just by whispers.
She tried to explain we all did equivalent with our fingertips.
She had an undeveloped skill in explaining;
the pedagogy of unwrapping misconceptions.
How is it she indicated our fingertips?
The action of willing is more aptly modelled
not as our trembling darling branches
but the birth of all wind --
towards the world from nowhere:
in us it follows an organised repetition of perspective.
You see, when you mean for your fingertips to move --
by reason of that senseless movement
something is understood, like a force between two stars.
Proof of miracles is lunacy and no more.
That's where we're best to trust, not in secret but
private, of passing over in quietness.
Still, the whispered-flight of that seed mote-like:
never have I watched anything with such seriousness
and lack of comprehension cathedral eclipsing.
And yet, what is brighter? The world or what is in it?
Nothing shines like the world.
The slow oil of darkness bores
the quick ink of nightmares misquote.
Nothing reasons like the world.


Oh I am lost here. Do
I misquote?
Nothing chills the heart-blood more.
To offend another living one: 
be afraid of that. Here I am afraid
like a scurrying bird in loss of faith in wing
my yellow-ringed eye wide up-looking
to sharp fragments of a cat's fury;
then, not really dead, improper sacrifice left scuppered
under the dining-room table an obnoxious idol:
even if given of love. It's unreasonable.
These predatory programs, the dark is useful to them.
There's nowhere to relax. Nothing for peace.
Just keeping to yourself. Keep your head down.
Oh, all advice condescends. Have I 
given any? Ignore it. Or don't -- I don't know. Goodnight.

‘Good questions contain three elements, says Abrahams:


They're concise, so the listener doesn't get distracted
They build on what the other person has said — furthering the conversation, rather than paraphrasing or summarizing
They revolve around a focused idea, or the conversation topic's "bottom line"
"It can have multiple purposes," but it should be quick, clear and focused enough so people understand the point of I'm trying to make," Abrahams says.


You should consider your intention or goal before asking any question, he adds. Do you want show you're listening and understanding, or that you're very interested in the subject at hand? Maybe you want to subtly help the other person understand another perspective, or simply move the conversation along.’

Remember, the condition of resolute positivity, of see-no-evil-hear-no-evil, and the grind of joy and laundry that attend these – is not ‘natural’ and ‘default’, nor the already ordained goal of some teleological enlightenment. Instead, here we have found a resolution and delight discerned through the incidental features of living as a human animal (admixed with the phenomenal vantage).


More plainly communicated, it has always been natural for people to get cross and to tangle themselves and others in intolerable knots. The antisocial habits urge themselves as right. So it is to be emphasised and remembered: the fair way is unnaturally feeling and counterintuitively regarded. A trust for the fair way, then, us the thing.

They insist on the ossification of the symbolic chain in the form of ‘slogan’, e.g. ‘ACAB’ in the context of explaining that ‘by defending any part or person of a system identified as problematic then you are guilty by association’.


That is my key point: the ‘guilt by association’ mechanism. Is it metonymy, technically speaking? Curious that this itself features as an elemental mechanism of symbolic articulation and sense.


We can train ourselves in following technique: suspend each statement not of its speaker, but the value that you find yourself ascribing to its speaker; e.g. ‘Elon Musk’, ‘Kamala Harris’, ‘Tommy Robinson’, ‘Andrew Tate’, ‘Jeremy Corbyn’, etc. etc.; the context of who the speaker is and their agenda will remain, of course, contributive to the statement articulated. That said, as a first approximation, a good strategy is to ‘double blind’ yourself from the identity of the speaker temporarily so as to get a fair sense of the statement’s suspended value; after this, reveal to yourself the identity of the speaker in order to learn its context and consider how your first interpretation may need revision (different speakers can mean very different things even when using identical words). Now, the heart of the matter: you can freely think about the statements on the value of their own terms, suspended from the ‘value by association’ of their speaker (note that this is true for both poles of the valence).

I will not permit thee to say or to think that it came from not-being; for it is impossible to think or to say that not-being is.

All articulate knowledge is arbitrary in the particular sense of belonging to our symbolic sense. That is why the continuum will generate for us endless strings of ‘Dedekind cut’ digits. This is not from, then, Nature’s own engine, some elastic continuum of physical substance, but from the ‘substance’ of the symbolic structure itself. It is with the symbolic structure that we legitimately interface Nature (as well as with which we make our polite, scientific enquiries of her).


In other words, for example, the epsilon-delta mechanism of limits controls our ‘arbitrarily accurate’ interface with the infinite by faithfully replicating for formal mathematics the arbitrary structure of the symbolic continuum. The disappointing betrayal of the conjuring trick of the Infinitesimal Calculus is just that the primary data itself was not an ‘objective’ infinitesimal but a datum measured out by some arbitration of accuracy: the algebraic allegiance under the logic of limits leverages this primary arbitration for accuracy.

Consider a bird approaching a tree. How close are they at different times? [‘The [bird] doesn’t just teleport from one position to another; it smoothly transitions through an infinite number of positions as it moves’ (ChatGPT-o, 28/8/24)]. We could measure; we could take photographs and set up a measuring visual. However, already in this scenario we are arbitrating for an approximation in order to make a measurement: when exactly does the tip of the bird’s beak meet our (infinitely fine?) indicator of measurement? We can’t have used a limit already in order to build our preliminary data – we simply decide, perhaps according to the best mechanistic affordance following the latest understanding of quantum physics and present research budget allowances. In other words, an arbitration. Not an objectively perfect measure.

‘The formal definition of a limit, introduced by [Augustin-Louis] Cauchy and [Karl] Weierstrass in the 19th century, offers a rigorous way to deal with the concept of approaching a point’ (cGPT).


‘It works because it establishes that as xx gets arbitrarily close to cc, the value f(x)f(x) gets arbitrarily close to LL. This rigour removes ambiguity and makes the concept of limits mathematically sound’ (cGPT). This is not satisfactory. The notion of arbitrary closeness is introduced and used as if self-explanatory or self-grounding; and then, wherefore the claim to ‘rigour’ and ‘soundness’? No rigour has been used to demonstrate this evaluation of rigour, and the same for the soundness.


Though, we do become aware of ‘convergence’ via partial sums (i.e. from an infinite series), as well as the ‘entanglement’ of the epsilon and delta.


‘One of the most profound aspects of limits is how they bridge the gap between discrete and continuous mathematics’ (cGPT).

‘A new Nature Human Behaviour study, jointly led by Dr. Margherita Malanchini at Queen Mary University of London and Dr. Andrea Allegrini at University College London, has revealed that non-cognitive skills, such as motivation and self-regulation, are as important as intelligence in determining academic success. These skills become increasingly influential throughout a child's education, with genetic factors playing a significant role.’


"We've found compelling evidence that non-cognitive skills—such as grit, perseverance, academic interest, and value attributed to learning—are not only significant predictors of success but that their influence grows stronger over time.”


"We discovered that genetic effects associated with non-cognitive skills become increasingly predictive of academic achievement over the school years. In fact, their effect nearly doubles between the ages of 7 and 16," explained Dr. Allegrini, Research Fellow at University College London.’

In other words, he identifies a way to maintain fidelity in regard to distinct languages-games, arithmetic statement as distinct from simple autobiographical assertion, at the same time as generalising for their submission to ‘incontrovertible’ symbolic articulations of knowledge.

Whose most convenient formula is ‘the meaning of life is…’, and in the infinitely more appropriate modality (not symbolic but as ‘spectacle’ – nb ‘perception’ is yet a symbolic process) can be represented as the beatific vision, the experience of the face of God, or the Sufi or mystical realisation of union with the divinely One. 


I am talking about the relation between meaning, desire, the void, the articulation of meaningful desire through the ‘gravitational orbit’ of pursuing the lure of a spectacle of identified or revealed meaning, that is, as a ground or generative source of meaning in a form or specified presentation that ‘makes sense’.


Really, we cannot even here, especially now, theorise and formally explain the ‘sense of meaning’. That would be an equivalent bad turn; that would only arrest meaning. So, I can go so far, and then detach in silence.


The void. Or perhaps the abyss. This is the space of nothing we encounter when, as it were, forcing an interview with the Divine. Not only does He not show up, but leaves proof of the pointlessness of the whole world. The inverse husk of a God-shape.


Faith works by baiting through a sign of the miraculous. The meaningfulness is located in the experience of naive following; the bait is not a glimpse of the thing itself but an ambiguous glimpse of the effect of the thing itself. As soon as one recognises the truth of the situation, one undermines one’s naivety and thereby one’s access to meaning. One does not get there through knowledge but by innocent experiences.


Lacan gives us the run around. This is an impression given by the action of his appropriate silence at points of anticipated explication of meaning and, especially, despite. This action, if thought of as a mere rhetoric, is what establishes Lacan as a subject who knows, as a Master.


Blake holy all that lives. If it is said that or thought that ‘all that lives is holy’ – then nothing is. Blake’s expression is true and must only be ‘realised’ as true, which cannot come about ‘in sense’ but indeed may come about because of one of any of the effects of sense. [only via poetry – which means, by generation of private effect, a private language, and not an articulate sense – but an absolute qualitative ‘the world is enough’. Here, of course, I say too much and diminish both our understanding; I ought perhaps to have stopped enigmatically and masterfully at the anacoluthon.]


Signified is always phenomenally experiential and is without sense though emerges in our perception and cognition only through articulate sense; it is a-symbolic. It is where the quality stands for itself, intrinsic and absolute. [Would be nice to clarify in a footnote or somewhere why ‘absolute’ here – if it is to mean anything beyond the tautology of ‘not relative’ or ‘not symbolic’ etc.] Where sense had emerged and would continue to work well enough all by itself in terms of ‘making sense’ through the processes of living organisms, through a world of all behaviour, the novel irruption and emergence of the phenomenal vantage and its qualitative experience, presents a curious temptation: that ‘sense’ be located and sourced in the quale, in the experiential, rather than is the case, the public behaviour and ‘uses’ comprising our Lebensform. This temptation is due to the phenomenal experience of meaning; our primary superstition is to take meaning for the origin and generative engine of ‘sense’. This is, roughly speaking, the story of Wittgenstein’s move from the logic of the proposition as pictured in the Tractatus to the self-organisational ‘games’ described in the Investigations, and likewise Austin’s move from the constative as distinct from performative, to the constative as one-act-among-all speech performance. [Both told incomplete stories – if only in misrecognition of the validity, indeed, of the principles upon which they both precisely embarked: the proposition is indeed a special child of meaning (i.e. not sense), and the constative is indeed distinct from the repertoire of speech-acts. These equivalent misrecognitions serve to confuse both thinkers into twining a few unnecessary mislabelings here and there, and ultimately to miss the place of phenomenal consciousness as not a part of symbolic communication. Wittgenstein comes closest here, as clear in his latter work, ‘On Certainty’, and in his careful treatment of the phenomenal vantage (‘beetle’) as neither a ‘Something’ – ‘but not a Nothing either’. This latter crucial understanding as misunderstood by Ryle, Dennett, Frankish, etc.] For example, we may explain what ‘rabbit’ means by deferring to other words in the dictionary and going on from one word to the next, round and round; why does this not quite happen in practice? Well, since we already have some sense known to us through our Lebensform, and as such we can ground the temporarily circuitous passing from one dictionary definition to another. In short, the richest definition of ‘rabbit’ is to point at rabbit, where the social practice of pointing out and labelling is an already established repertoire in our language game. Compare this, therefore, with how we might attempt to define the appearance of ‘green’ or the experience of ‘pain’; the best we can do is point to green surfaces in our environment or pinch our interlocutor and declare ‘That! That feeling is the quality of pain.’ How is this different to the rabbit example? Indeed, why should I not say something equivalent like ‘The appearance and quality of a rabbit is ineffable’? Well, since we can easily enough describe the parts and appearance of a rabbit, and can happily enough develop into facts about rabbits and their fur etc. But we cannot do this for the qualities of perception, of our phenomenal experience. More accurately, and as Wittgenstein noted, it is not that we ‘cannot’, but that we ‘could not’ – there is no lack or loss or inability concerning phenomenal experience as compared to the articulate objects of our perception; instead, it is the case that our Lebensform also includes the phenomenal vantage: ‘I am that I am’ and ‘the quality of pain’ and ‘the appearance of green’ are a nature of poetry, signifiers for the signified at the level of the signifier. This is a species of mistake, since significance is achieved precisely when the signifier arbitrates (‘leaves off’ or disappears) for our realisation of meaning, the experience itself, which we call the ‘signified’ (and is a term we might understandably be tempted to do away with in exchange for the phrasing, ‘there is the signifier, and then there is the procedure of realising its significance, nothing else need be named’). So it is: we find it simple enough to order signifiers together to sign-post our generalising over the procedure of realising significance, e.g. ‘the signified’, the ‘phenomenal quality’, ‘conscious experience’, but do not see that we are neither signifying nor insignificant in doing so, that we are not just referring to something in the ordinary way and thereby in public communication with all other objects and ideas, but that we uniquely ‘fold’ our language upon the point of a singular co-incidence, the one place where it is both an empty well-formed-formula and nevertheless true. It is to say that ‘here I refer to and express the signified at the level of the signifier, a meaning at the level of sense, the reality of my consciousness reported like any other object, state, or process’. The primary superstition, thus, is thinking that we are speaking in the ordinary way, albeit perhaps about an interesting idea. This primary ‘sin’ leads us to the secondary temptation: to think that meaning is the kind of thing that can have or bear a ‘sense’. That it would be a significant thing to fence in a unicorn. No. For then we have only found a horse, with a horn. If we inherit magical powers – then these become the new normal, especially the more about magic we fence inside of knowledge that makes sense. Magic no longer means magic when it makes sense.


But things that do not make sense are not necessarily magical, are not even meaningful. So what is the distinction of the magical? Speaking naturalistically, the magical is a sign for or representation of existential meaning, of ‘the world’ being pregnant in meaning. More technically perhaps, it is the representation of our desire ignited in the quest for meaning. It is the experience of the bait, the lure, and our naive and uniquely thereby successful pursuit.


Naive here does not mean ‘subject to trickery’ or ‘foolish’. What can it mean, then? Something connected to Blake's idea of ‘Innocence’? Ah, earlier I think I rightly contrasted ‘innocent experience’ (idle or qualitative phenomenality) with ‘symbolic, articulate knowledge, including scientific knowledge’ (oh perhaps hence Blake's ‘damning’ of Newtonianism?)

Perhaps this is the source of our superstition of teleology: there is a telos, but it is a necessary pathway or method (metamanoeuvre for what has happened thus far) but with an open, eternal horizon.]


[I think what Saussure really described was phenomenal consciousnesses interface with symbolic communication, and not just symbolic communication itself. There is some overlap, and people take him for the latter; really, and I further intuit, his ‘arbitrary structure’ identifies with ‘idleness’].

Amazing conversation with ChatGTP-o, Sunday 25th August 2024.


[BN:] I'd argue that, first, 'over' and 'done' do indeed form a single concept: as you have stated before, they share and place emphasis on the concept of finality. Second, I'd point out that hendiadys does not necessarily have to restrict itself to the conjunction of nouns, but would achieve similar rhetorical results via qualifiers (i.e. adjectival morphemes in this case). Would you agree? I am interested in your contrast between collocation and hendiadys; presently, my intuition is that this is not a mutually exclusive distinction. What do you think, friend?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You raise a compelling argument, and it's worth considering how the idiom "over and done with" might be interpreted within the framework of hendiadys, particularly given the flexibility of rhetorical devices.
Let's break down your points:
1. Shared Concept of Finality: Indeed, "over" and "done" do reinforce each other to convey a single, unified concept of finality. In this sense, they work together to express a complete idea, which aligns with the purpose of hendiadys: using two terms to convey a more nuanced or emphasized meaning than either could alone. If we view "over and done" as working together to stress the notion of something being fully concluded, this could be seen as analogous to how hendiadys typically functions.
2. Flexibility of Hendiadys: You're correct that hendiadys is not strictly limited to the conjunction of nouns. While traditionally associated with nouns, hendiadys can occur with other parts of speech, such as adjectives or verbs, provided they work together to form a single concept or to create a heightened effect. In this sense, the combination of "over" (which can function as an adjective or adverb) and "done" (a past participle functioning adjectivally) can be seen as a broader application of hendiadys, where the emphasis on finality is achieved through the combination of these two qualifiers.
3. Collocation vs. Hendiadys: The distinction between collocation and hendiadys is not necessarily mutually exclusive. A collocation refers to words that are commonly used together and understood as a phrase with a particular meaning. However, if a collocation serves to intensify or elaborate a single concept, it can simultaneously function as hendiadys. In this case, "over and done with" could be both a collocation and an example of hendiadys, depending on the rhetorical intention behind its use.
Conclusion: I agree that "over and done with" can be viewed through the lens of hendiadys, particularly when we consider the rhetorical effect it achieves by combining these terms to emphasize finality. The distinction between collocation and hendiadys isn't mutually exclusive; rather, in this case, the idiom might serve as an example of both. Your intuition is sound, and this perspective adds a valuable layer of analysis to the phrase.

3. John von Neumann: "The brain is a fantastically complex organ, and it is very difficult to understand how it works. But I believe that consciousness is a product of the brain's activity." (Von Neumann, J. (1958). The Computer and the Brain.)
4. David Chalmers: "The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience." (Chalmers, D. J. (1996). The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory. Oxford University Press.)
5. Francis Crick: "The problem of consciousness is the most important unsolved problem in biology." (Crick, F. (1994). The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul.)
6. Daniel Dennett: "Consciousness is a complex illusion created by the brain's neural activity." (Dennett, D. C. (1991). Consciousness Explained.)
7. Karl Friston: "Consciousness is a process of Bayesian inference, whereby the brain constructs a model of the world and updates it based on sensory input." (Friston, K. (2010). The free-energy principle: A unified brain theory? Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11(2), 127-138.)
8. Henri Poincaré: "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe." (Poincaré, H. (1903). Science and Hypothesis.)
9. Albert Einstein: "The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible." (Einstein, A. (1931). The World As I See It.)
10. Alan Watts: "Consciousness is not a product of the brain, but rather the brain is a product of consciousness." (Watts, A. (1967). The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are.)
11. Steven Pinker: "Consciousness is a biological phenomenon, like digestion or respiration." (Pinker, S. (2012). The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.)

Revised Quotes 14-20
14. Thomas Nagel: "What is it like to be a bat? An answer to this question would have to specify not just the qualitative content of bat experiences, but also the subjective character of those experiences. And that, I believe, is something we cannot specify." (Nagel, T. (1974). What is it like to be a bat? Philosophical Review, 83(4), 435-450.)
15. George Berkeley: "To be is to be perceived. This is not a maxim or principle, but a truth that is necessarily implied by the very meaning of existence. For what can exist besides things that are perceived or perceivable?" (Berkeley, G. (1710). A Treatise of Human Knowledge.)
16. Gottfried Leibniz: "Monads have no windows. By this I mean that each monad is a simple substance, which does not have any parts and cannot be divided. Monads are also self-sufficient, meaning that they do not need anything external to them in order to exist or to act." (Leibniz, G. W. (1695). Discourse on Metaphysics.)
17. René Descartes: "I think, therefore I am. This is the first principle of philosophy, which is certain and evident, and which cannot be doubted. For in order to doubt, I must be thinking. And if I am thinking, then I must exist." (Descartes, R. (1637). Discourse on Method.)
18. Immanuel Kant: "The transcendental unity of apperception is the fundamental principle of consciousness, which allows us to unify our experiences into a coherent whole. This principle is not empirical, but rather a transcendental condition of the possibility of experience." (Kant, I. (1781). Critique of Pure Reason.)
19. John Locke: "Tabula rasa is a Latin phrase that means 'blank slate.' It is a philosophical concept that suggests that the mind is born empty and that all knowledge is acquired through experience." (Locke, J. (1690). An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.)
20. David Hume: "A bundle of perceptions is a metaphor used by Hume to describe the nature of the self. He argued that the self is not a substance or a thing, but rather a collection of perceptions that are constantly changing." (Hume, D. (1739). A Treatise of Human Nature.)
